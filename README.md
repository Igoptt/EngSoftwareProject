A system will be created to support the prescription of medications, treatments and exercise. The main motivation is to dematerialize these types 
of processes and ensure a more effective control of compliance with the prescribed therapy.
The system will be based on a design that ensures the system's extensibility and adaptability to new requirements, whether functional or non-functional. 
Therefore, the need to find an architecture that allows for easy modification and extensibility of the editor will be taken into account.

For this we created an authentication page that allows normal use, log in if you are already registered in the system, if that doesn't happen we have the 
option to create a new user.
