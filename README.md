A system will be created to support the prescription of medications, treatments and exercise. The main motivation is to dematerialize these types 
of processes and ensure a more effective control of compliance with the prescribed therapy.
The system will be based on a design that ensures the system's extensibility and adaptability to new requirements, whether functional or non-functional. 
Therefore, the need to find an architecture that allows for easy modification and extensibility of the editor will be taken into account.

For this we created an authentication page that allows normal use, log in if you are already registered in the system, if that doesn't happen we have the 
option to create a new user.

When registering, we can create an account as a therapist or as a client.

Therapsit can also create a service to add to the prescription, like medicines, exercicies and treatments

To add a prescription to a session, it is only possible to a session that has already taken place.
If you want to test, adding the prescription to the session, you must double click above the date. Disable "Automatically set time" and then change time "Manually set date and time".
